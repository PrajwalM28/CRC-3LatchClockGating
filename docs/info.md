## How it works

The CRC-3 Module with Latch-Based Clock Gating is a compact error detection system designed for a 1x1 tile chip. It uses a 3-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) to compute a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) based on the polynomial \(x^3 + x + 1\) (binary `1011`). Data is fed serially via the `data_in` input, and the module processes it bit-by-bit on each clock cycle when enabled. A latch-based clock gating mechanism reduces power consumption by disabling the clock when the `enable` signal (`ui_in[0]`) is low, using a latch to stabilize the enable signal and prevent glitches. The resulting 3-bit CRC value is output on `uo_out[2:0]`, which can be compared at the receiver to detect data errors.

# How to test

## How to test

To test the CRC-3 module, use a Verilog testbench to simulate the design. Set `rst_n` low to reset the module, then drive `ui_in[0]` high to enable clock gating and feed serial data through `ui_in[1]`. For example, input the data `110100` (padded with 3 zeros as `110100000`) and verify that the output `uo_out[2:0]` matches the expected CRC (e.g., `101` for this sequence). Toggle `ui_in[0]` to test power-saving behavior by observing clock activity. Use a waveform viewer (e.g., GTKWave) to confirm the CRC computation and clock gating functionality after each clock cycle.
