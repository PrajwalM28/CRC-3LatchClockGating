# CRC-3 Module with Latch-Based Clock Gating

Overview

This project implements a CRC-3 (Cyclic Redundancy Check) module optimized with Latch-Based Clock Gating for low-power operation. It is designed for integration into a 1×1 Tiny Tapeout tile chip.

The system computes a 3-bit CRC using a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) based on the polynomial:

P(x) = x^3 + x + 1 \quad (binary\ 1011)

The latch-based clock gating technique reduces power by disabling the clock when not needed, while preventing glitches with a transparent latch.

I/O Description

Signal	Direction	Description

clk	Input	System clock
rst_n	Input	Active-low reset
ui_in[0]	Input	Enable signal for latch-based clock gating
ui_in[1]	Input	Serial data input
uo_out[2:0]	Output	3-bit CRC value

How It Works

1. When ui_in[0] = 1, the gated clock is enabled and data bits from ui_in[1] are shifted into the LFSR.


2. The CRC-3 calculation follows the polynomial (x^3 + x + 1).


3. When ui_in[0] = 0, the gated clock is disabled, freezing internal logic to save power.


4. The final 3-bit CRC result is available at uo_out[2:0].

How to Test

1. Reset the module by setting rst_n = 0, then release (rst_n = 1).


2. Enable clock gating by driving ui_in[0] = 1.


3. Feed serial data through ui_in[1].

Example: input sequence 110100 (pad with 3 zeros → 110100000)

Expected CRC output = 101



4. Disable clock gating (ui_in[0] = 0) and observe that the internal clock stops toggling.


5. Check results using a simulation tool (e.g., Icarus Verilog + GTKWave).
